# Azure Web Application with Application Gateway Deployment using Terraform

Hey there! Welcome to my project on deploying an Azure Web Application with an Application Gateway using Terraform. I'm excited to showcase how Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can help us easily provision and manage Azure resources in a consistent and scalable way.

## Project Description

In this project, I'll walk you through the steps to create an Azure Web Application and configure it to be accessible through an Application Gateway, all with the help of Terraform. To get started, make sure you have the following files handy:

- `main.tf`: This is where the magic happens - it contains the main Terraform configuration for creating our Azure resources.
- `variables.tf`: I've defined some variables in this file to customize the configuration based on our needs.
- `terraform.tfvars`: Now, let's populate this file with the actual values for our variables.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, let's ensure we have the necessary prerequisites:

- Azure Subscription: If you don't have an Azure account, you can easily sign up for a free trial at [azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).
- Terraform Installed: To follow along, make sure you have Terraform installed on your local machine. Don't worry, you can download the latest version from the official Terraform website: [terraform.io](https://terraform.io).

## Deployment Steps

Let's get our Azure Web Application with an Application Gateway up and running! Just follow these simple steps:

1. First, clone this repository to your local development environment. It's always great to have everything handy in one place.

2. Now, let's set up our Azure credentials to allow Terraform to authenticate with our Azure subscription. We need that access!

3. Next, navigate to the project directory and locate the following Terraform files: `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `terraform.tfvars`. These are our building blocks for success.

4. Take a moment to review these files and customize them based on our specific requirements. Let's make this deployment truly our own.

5. It's time to get our hands dirty! Open up a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and execute the following commands:

   ```shell
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

   Just like that, Terraform will work its magic, initializing, generating an execution plan, and applying the changes to create our Azure resources.

6. Let's not forget to double-check the output of the `terraform apply` command. We want to make sure our resources were created successfully. Pay attention to any important details, such as URLs or connection strings.

7. Once we're done with our amazing resources, we can easily clean up. Just use the command `terraform destroy` to remove all the created Azure resources and tidy up our environment.

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed this journey through deploying an Azure Web Application with an Application Gateway using Terraform. By leveraging Infrastructure as Code and the power of Terraform, we've made the process seamless, repeatable, and easily manageable.

Feel free to explore the provided Terraform files and make any modifications to suit your unique needs. Happy coding and may your deployments be smooth sailing!
